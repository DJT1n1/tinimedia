            <h2> About Us </h2>
            <br>
            <h3> What we do?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> You might be asking what is it that Tini Media Group does. Well to be to the point, curently we are a small team that has one goal in mind, to make content that people can enjoy.
                We are always looking for new and exciting content to add to our platform. We are more than thrilled to talk to you about Sponsorships or partnerships alike. However, I don't think
                it is very clear as to what our true goal is.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> We want to make the best content we possibly can across any of our channels. The main channel is the Nicolas Constantini YouTube channel. Where the founder Nicolas streams and 
                uploads whatever content he feels like. We have more channels in the works with great idea's and we hope to flesh them out shortly and will update this section in the future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Nicolas is always looking to try and learn new hobbies the most recent one being Website design, he has also dabbled in the last 4 years with 3D Modelling, 3D Printing, and
                Table-top Role Playing Game Game Mastering.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We refuse to let people tell us its not possible and we make the impossible possible. We obsess over learning everything we can about new hobbies, and we are here to help you learn
                and grow in the content and media space.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What makes us different?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> What makes us different from the other YouTubers on the platform? Well, we obsess over the minor details because no detail or analytic is too small to gloss over. We have invested 
                not only time but also money in making sure that we understand the YouTube algorithim. We do this with every project we take on, we obsess invest the time and money to make sure
                that we understand what it is we are focused on whether it be the niche of content we are making or whether it be a project as simple as this website. We are working tirelessly to improve
                everything we do to the best of our ability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are we looking for?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> We are currently looking to make connections with other content creators who want to learn how the content creation world works. We want to help those people and we want the 
                same energy reciprocated. As for what the group needs at this moment, we could really use an editor who would like to volunteer their time to edit videos so that we can focus on
                the content itself knowing that the editor can handle polishing the video to the best of their ability and get it YouTube ready.
